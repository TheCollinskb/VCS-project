## Introduction
A **Version Control System (VCS)** is a tool that helps track changes in code, documents, or any set of files over time.  
It allows teams to:
- Collaborate without overwriting each otherâ€™s work.
- Revert to previous versions if mistakes are made.
- Maintain a clear history of changes.


## Key Concepts

| Term | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| **Repository** | A storage location for your project files and history. |
| **Commit** | A snapshot of changes made to the codebase. |
| **Branch** | A parallel version of the repository for isolated changes. |
| **Merge** | Combining changes from one branch into another. |
| **Clone** | Creating a local copy of a remote repository. |
| **Pull** | Fetching and integrating changes from a remote repository. |
| **Push** | Sending your local changes to a remote repository. |


## Popular Version Control Systems
1. **Git** (Most popular, distributed, open-source)
2. **Subversion (SVN)** (Centralized)
3. **Mercurial**
4. **Perforce**


## Why Use Version Control
- **Collaboration**: Multiple people can work on the same project.
- **History Tracking**: Every change is recorded.
- **Backup**: Code is safely stored in the cloud or remote servers.
- **Branching**: Experiment without affecting main code.



## Basic Git Workflow

Branching Strategy
Common strategies:

Main/Develop:

main for production-ready code.

develop for ongoing development.

Feature Branches: For new features.

Hotfix Branches: For urgent production fixes.

Release Branches: For preparing production releases.

Example:

``` bash
Copy
Edit
main
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ develop
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ feature/user-auth
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ feature/payment-api
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ hotfix/login-bug
```
* Best Practices

âœ… Commit often with clear messages.
âœ… Use .gitignore to avoid committing unnecessary files.
âœ… Pull before pushing to reduce merge conflicts.
âœ… Keep branches focused on a single task/feature.
âœ… Regularly review pull requests.

## Common Git Commands

Command Description

* Git  Initialize a new local repository
* Git   clone a remote repository
* Git status changes in the working directory
* Git add file stage changes for commmit
* Git commit -m "message" Commit staged changes
* Git pull fetch and merge remote changes
* Git push Push commits to remote repository
* Git branch List branches
* Git checkout <branch> Switch branches
* Git merge branch another branch into current branch


## Why Use Version Control

### Example Commands:
bash
# 1. Initialize a new Git repository
git init

![Git-init](./img/gitinit.png)

# 2. Stage changes
git add .

![Git-add](./img/gitadd.png)

# 3. Commit staged changes and pushed to main branch
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main
